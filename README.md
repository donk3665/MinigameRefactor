# Overview
This is a fighting and rhythmFiles game created in Java. Javadoc included.
The characters in the fighting game have a modular design since the properties of their moveset are written in a text file that the program reads.
You can also easily add songs in the rhythmFiles game since the program reads in .osu files from osu.ppy.sh for its levels.

To get started, head to the releases tab on the right and download the jar file of the latest release. 
Run the jar file, and everything else should work. 

If you want to build and compile the program yourself, you'll need a download of javafx. Once downloaded, you will need to run the program with the 
following VM arguments: --module-path <path-to-your-javafx-lib-folder> --add-modules=javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.media
