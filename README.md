# Overview
This is a fighting and rhythmFiles game created in Java. Javadoc included.
The characters in the fighting game have a modular design since the properties of their moveset are written in a text file that the program reads.
You can also easily add songs in the rhythmFiles game since the program reads in .osu files from osu.ppy.sh for its levels.
